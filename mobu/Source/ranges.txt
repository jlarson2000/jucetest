With the move to ordinal values for as much as possible I'm hating the
old low/high concepts.

What we really need for bindings is the sweep range.  The starting value will
always be zero.

Most if not all integer values have a meaningful zero though some like trackCount
would make sense to have a low of 1.

Structure enumerations and track/loop activators are the problems.  The end user
always thinks in terms of "track 1" rather than "track 0" although track 1 has
index 0 internally.

simple enumeration parameters are 0 based.


So the configuration UI and device bindings want to be zero based.

But scripts and binding arguments want to be 1 based.

I think it's going to be confusing to make "ordinal" mean one thing and "object number"
mean another.  Does it work to have a parameter where ordinals always start from zero
but if low=1 it means that binding arguments are 1 based?

The UI would use low to decorate slider or menu items, which is nice to know.
when low=1 it just means that ordinal zero is unused or has special meaning.

Yeah, I think that's what we have to do


    MIDI Binding from key 42 with destination track 1 means the first track
    "set activeTrack 1" from a script means the first track

range=128 without a low means low=0 high=127 but is that a useful shorthand?

Ugh, this makes structure enumerations behave differently than simple enumerations
where the base value is always zero.

Although for certain structure, zero can be reserved to mean "nothing selected". This
would be the case for binding overlays.  Hmm, could also use this in SetupTrack to
mean "the default preset defined at a higher level".  If you wanted a global preset
that applies everywhere, or rather a Setup.defaultPreset, then a setupTrack.activePreset
that overrides that.
