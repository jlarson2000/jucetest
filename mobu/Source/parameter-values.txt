what we have now

    /**
     * Methods implemented by subclasses to get and set the value
     * of a parameter from the configuration objects.
     */

    virtual void getConfigValue(void* object, class ExValue* value) = 0;
    virtual void setConfigValue(void* object, class ExValue* value) = 0;

    /**
     * New interface just for the Juce UI with complicated values.
     */
    virtual void getJuceValue(void* object, juce::var& value);
    virtual void setJuceValue(void* object, juce::var& value);

There is no getOrdinal in Parameter

Subclasses define getOrdinalValue

    /**
     * This must be overloaded by anything that supports ordinals.
     */
	virtual int getOrdinalValue(MobiusConfig* c);


    /**
     * This must be overloaded by anything that supports ordinals.
     */
	virtual int getOrdinalValue(Preset* p);

ParameterTrack does not

What I want


Parameter
  int getOrdinalValue(object* obj)
     can't implement in terms of ExValue because of the enumeration conversion
     have to undo that which sucks
     
  void setOrdinalValue(object* obj, int value)
    has never existed
    could use in the UI if we had it
    will want in MobiusSimulator to implement doAction





----------------------------------------------------------------------







Parameter needs to support these value accessors

// for int, bool, enum values get/set the number
// this is enough for almost everything except the few
// that are multi-valued or strings

  int getOrdinalValue
  void setOrdinalValue

we can't expect things like TrackPresetParameter to support ordinals
since the name-to-Preset ordinal needs more context

  getConfigValue
  setConfigValue

supports all data types

the last two are currently pure virtual and used by the preset editor
the first two are all the preset editor really needs

Really disliking the enum mapping happening automatically

for things that are enums could instead require

   int ordinal = getOrdinalValue
   const char* symbol = getEnumName(ordinal)

for the things that care

would like getConfigValue to return ordinals only and require the mapping above
