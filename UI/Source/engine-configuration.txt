  calls mobius->configure

Mobius
  if there is a pending core configuration
    coming in too fast or core not running
    warn and ignore
    can't replace pending without a csect, and even ten it's tricky
    
  copies MobiusConfiguration for internal use above the interrpt
  makes another copy and sets it pending for the core

Core
  wakes up on an audio buffer and ckecks to see if it has a pending config
  takes it and clears the pending pointer

  safe mode
    does a global reset
    reconfigures tracks
    copies setup and preset parameters into the tracks


  smart mode
    if track count or loop changed
      global reset...
    else
      copy parameters into the tracks
      only "non structural" parameters are copied


fundamental concent!
  scheduled events either need to carry with them critical parameters
  from the last active preset, or they need to behave gradcefully if the
  parameter changes afer it was scheduled and before it runs

  same applies to setting parameters from scripts so should be okay


core global reset
  revert presets copied into tracks so what is in the master core config
