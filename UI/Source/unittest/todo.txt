Nice to have multiple levels of mobius-redirect files
Support multiple lines in redirect with # comments

Echo to send to both stdout and debug console

relative paths in ScriptConfig
relative paths in SampleConfig

lobotomize UnitTestSetup for now, rely on pre-configured mobius.xml

Obey noExternalAudio

If we defer sample loading, need a LoadSamples function

While we're there LoadScripts
  - change menu to just call the two new functions with UIAction

Want buttons to dynamically reconfigure every time scripts are loaded
  - see dynamic-configuration.txt for thoughs here

Someday would like one-off script loading not bound up in ScriptConfig.
