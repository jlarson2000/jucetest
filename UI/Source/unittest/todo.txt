UnitTestSetup
  wants to install a Preset and a Setup, I guess that's okay
  keep for now but we don't have to now that we have mobius.xml redirect

MobiusConfig::setCurrentPreset
  need to nail down the concept of a default global preset
  the SetupTrack can override it, but it should not be required to have
  these set in every track.  If not set fall back to the default

Sample loading
  samples are no longer loaded automatically, must use the LoadSamples action
  I suppose we could have a "load on startup" option
  Unit tests will call LoadSamples many times as part of their standard
  test initialization sequence, function needs to do diff checking before sending
  down to the Kernel

  basically on load, Shell keeps it's own copy of the unloaded SampleConfig
  on reload, test this against what is currently in MobiusConfig and only reload
  if the path names differ

  Can have a "force" argument in the binding args.  For sample loading from the UI,
  always include force

Duplicate Script Compilation
  seeing two sets of compliler trace, one when initializing the Kernel and another
  when shell calculates the dynmaic actions.  shell should build a dynamic info object
  before sending it down, and return that every time

LoadScripts doesn't need diff checking like Samples but it could
  alternately have this in the SampleConfig, autoload=true only for the config
  in the unit test directory?

Parameter aliases
  unit tests use old names like 8thsPerCycle and moreLoops
  see how widesparead those are and consider putting aliases back
  probably easier just to change the tests

noLayerFlattening
  make sure this global param works

StartAudioRecording
  used frequenly in tests

See "Proc Difftest
  StopAudioRecording
  
    # these will be processed in order on the mobius thread
  SaveLoop ./$(testname)$(suffix)loop
  Wait thread
  SaveAudioRecording ./$(testname)$(suffix)rec
  Wait thread

  going to need SaveLoop and SaveAudioRecording, bring those back

Diff
  Diff audio ./$(testname)rec
  will need that too with a KernelEvent

And diff



Proc RecordBackground

  Wait block
  StartAudioRecording
  Sample1
  Wait frame baseStartWait
  Record
  Wait frame baseEndWait
  Record
  Wait last

Endproc

  



relative paths in ScriptConfig
relative paths in SampleConfig

lobotomize UnitTestSetup for now, rely on pre-configured mobius.xml

Obey noExternalAudio

Someday would like one-off script loading not bound up in ScriptConfig.
