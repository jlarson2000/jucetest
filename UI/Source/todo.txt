util/Trace
  this wants a csect, either do that on our own or find
  a way to push Juce/container down nhere

util/Util

AppException
  see how widely used this is and find something new
  it allocates memory and is dangerous for audio

CopyString
  almost all uses of this can be migrated to std::

util/Vbuf
  replace with std::
  has some pointer arithmetic and doesn't use PTRDIFF

model/Binding
  Trigger contants are dynamically allocated!!
  need to use static objects so they can be auto-destructed

model/Preset
  had to pull in MAX_RATE_STEP and MAX_BEND_STEP from Resampler
  if the model is going to enforce these, they need to live there

model/Parameter
  lots of dynamic allocation
  lots of references to core objects

Export
  this seems like it is on the right track as far as the model but
  it has encapsulation issues in the definition and implementation
    requires Mobius among other things

might be time to separate ParameterDefinition from ParameterRuntime

util/KeyCode
  ugly stuff, but relatively simple
  should be a way to do this in Juce if not the standard libraries by now
