Did not advance sub or cycle because
it was right on the line

  startCycle was at the start of 2
  endCycle was in the middle of 2

  same for subcycle

So we did a loop beat but not a cycle/subcycle beat
because they were reached the interrupt before

It's all in the simulator, think carefully about this
