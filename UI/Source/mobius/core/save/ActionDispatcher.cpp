 * Perform an action, either synchronously or scheduled for the next

 *
 * This is the interface that must be called from anything "outside"
 * Mobius, which is any trigger that isn't the script interpreter.
 * Besides performing the Action, this is where we track down/up 
 * transitions and long presses.
 *
 * It may also be used by code "inside" the audio interrupt in which
 * case action->inInterrupt or TriggerEvent will be set.  
 *
 * If we're not in the interrupt, we usually defer all actions to the
 * beginning of the next interrupt.  The exceptions are small number
 * of global functions that have the "outsideInterrupt" option on.
 *
 * UI targets are always done synchronously since they don't effect 
 * the Mobius engine.
 * 
 * Originally we let TriggerHost run synchronously but that was wrong,
 * PluginParameter will track the last set value.
 *
 * Note that long press tracking is only done inside the interrupt
 * which means that the few functions that set outsideInterrupt and
 * the UI controls can't respond to long presses.  Seems fine.
