 * 
 * An abstract class all control surface interface classes
 * should extend.  Not much here now but it we'll need this as soon
 * as we support another surface like the APC40.
 *
 * The fundamental assumption is that a control surface is a
 * non-programmable device that sends and receives a fixed set
 * of MIDI events.  At least some of the MIDI events sent by the
 * surface pass through an extra level of mapping before they are
 * bound to Mobius targets.  This allows for "virtual pages" of bindings
 * to be applied to controls.  The effect is similar to switching
 * between BindingConfigs.
 *
 * Control surface events take precidence over normal MIDI bindings
 * there are two ways this could work:
 *
 *   - have the surface insert Actions into the BindingResolver
 *     that redirect the event to the surface handler
 *
 *   - pass incomming events through the surface handler and then
 *     if it doesn't want them send them through the BindingResolver
 *
 * The second is simpler to set up so we'll go with that for awhile.
 * During Mobius startup there should be some kind of warning if a 
 * surface overrides a MIDI binding.
