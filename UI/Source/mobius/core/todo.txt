Mobius::getState
  - don't need to be returning OverlayBindings?  Well I guess a script
    could have changed them

Mobius::getReportedLatency, getEffectiveInputLatency
  who uses this?

Mobius::setCustomMode
  vaguely remember this, scripts can invent their own modes and want the UI
  to display them

Mobius::internTarget
  removed resolutions for BindingConfig, I changed the name and we shouldn't
  be doing this down here

Mobius::isNoExternalInput etc.
  seems to be a testing hack when running in a context that has no audio coming in


  
Stream::capture
  writes Audio to file


Trigger etc.

A LOT of files are including OldBinding to get Trigger and Target
constants.  Factor that out and/or use the new Binding model, but
really most of this doesn't care about how bindings are defined

Have just Trigger.h Target.h or maybe BindingConstants.h
that can be used everywhere

Git MidiListener drug in for something, revisit everything that
thinks about Midi

Lost LoopSummary along the way
