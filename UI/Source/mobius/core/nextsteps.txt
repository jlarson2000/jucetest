next big mess: MobiusThread

merge Actionator::doInterruptActions
  and that TriggerState tracker

Long press record broke along the way
  need to completely rethink trigger handling and move as much
  as possible out of core

Bad leak after attempting long-press Record a few times
  doesn't have to be long, just do
    Record, Record
    let it play a little
    Record, Record
    Reset

So starting Record while a loop exists leaks


SampleManager plays into the input buffer, which causes input monitoring
to bounce, not innacurate really, but should we do monitoring at a higher
level and ignore what SampleManager does?
  - yes to higher level

Revisit setSetupInternal tail end of propagateConfiguration is a mess

For each of the major subcomponents
  ScriptInterpreter, Synchronizer, Actionator, Track
  organize the top part of the files according to
     initialize
     reconfigure
     audio buffers
     other stuff

StateExporter
  move top-level logic in here, consider pulling the component
  specific exporters: Track, Loop, Layer, EventManager
  into one place

Capture/Bounce
  move to a subcomponent?

Scriptarian
  still enough in Mobius to warrant a subcomponent

TrackManager
  is there enough to have a subcomponent?

MobiusThread
  still a big mess and it's all over Scripts

Parametizer
  Handle getParameter, UIParameter mapping
  - leave in Actionator for now, there isn't much there
  
Functionator
  handle the combined function/script map
  not much more here, Actionator does almost everything
  same with Parametizer, there's not much more to add, just
  keep everything in Actionator
  UIQuery can evolve there too

Variables
  hating these, at least condider generating but the logic
  isn't as regular as Parameter





  




----------------------------------------------------------------------


Got a single 32k block leaking from somewhere

Flesh out LayerElement, fix AudioMeter for input add smaller
AudioMeter for track strip output

Explore that other guy's meter

Revisit all the above/below interupt code in MObius and simplify it

Start propagation of MobiusConfig values on reconfigure
 - fix the function lists to use CSV rather than StringList
   - set flags directly on the Functions
   


Since we no longer use Parameter for the UI, and have moved bindings up
is there any need for the old getHigh, getOrdinalLabel, etc?  Weed them.
Unless scripts need them.

Sure would be nice to  factor Action and Export handling out of them so
we could share the model.


Go over the stuff in new and see what was used
