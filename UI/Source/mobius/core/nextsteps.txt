startup/configuration

Mobius no longer has to deal with above/below interrupt, everything is Kernel
except for a brief period during initialization.

Shell/Kernel can handle the gate that prevents interrupts from comming in before
being fully initialized.

Supervisor reads MobiusConfig file
  MobiusShell gets config config from Supervisor, makes two copies one
    for shell and one for Kernel

  Kernel wakes up and takes it's copy

  Kernel initializes core and shares it's MobiusConfig

  Mobius just keeps a handle to the Mobius config, and goes not modify it

  Mobius copies portions of the config to the Tracks
  
Keep an initialize/start interface in Mobius for the VST probing thing though
we won't use it yet?  Or can this be done higher, yes, shell should do that

Mobius() constructor
  don't do much

Mobius::initialize(kernel)
  save Kernel and pull Configuration and other things from it

MobiusContext
  formerly provided path names and two main interfaces
     AudioInterface
     MidiInterface
       leave these as stubs for now, but implement as bridges between
       core and Kernel/MobiusContainer

HostMidiInterface
  keep around briefly, need to refactor all midi handling to go through
  MobiusContainer
