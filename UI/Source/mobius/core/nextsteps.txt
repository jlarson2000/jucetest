Since we no longer use Parameter for the UI, and have moved bindings up
is there any need for the old getHigh, getOrdinalLabel, etc?  Weed them.
Unless scripts need them.

Sure would be nice to  factor Action and Export handling out of them so
we could share the model.


Go over the stuff in new and see what was used
