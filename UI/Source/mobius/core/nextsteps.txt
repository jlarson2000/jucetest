Go over Actionator and simplify the pending action list

Revisit setSetupInternal tail end of propagateConfiguration is a mess

Move Recorder back down
  - try to get rid of it entirely if possible
  - will need to factor out SampleTrack, latency calibraton
  - the thing about isPriority for "brother sync" may keep it alive for awhile

  ! yes, get rid of this, it won't be that hard

For each of the major subcomponents
  ScriptInterpreter, Synchronizer, Actionator, Track
  organize the top part of the files according to
     initialize
     reconfigure
     audio buffers
     other stuff

StateExporter
  move top-level logic in here, consider pulling the component
  specific exporters: Track, Loop, Layer, EventManager
  into one place

WTF did WatchPoints ever do?  Reconsider

Capture/Bounce
  move to a subcomponent?

Scriptarian
  still enough in Mobius to warrant a subcomponent

TrackManager
  is there enough to have a subcomponent?


MobiusThread
  still a big mess and it's all over Scripts


Parametizer
  Handle getParameter, UIParameter mapping

Functionator
  handle the combined function/script map
  not much more here, Actionator does almost everything
  same with Parametizer, there's not much more to add, just
  keep everything in Actionator
  UIQuery can evolve there too

Variables
  hating these, at least condider generating but the logic
  isn't as regular as Parameter

Got a single 32k block leaking from somewhere

Flesh out LayerElement, fix AudioMeter for input add smaller
AudioMeter for track strip output

Explore that other guy's meter

Revisit all the above/below interupt code in MObius and simplify it

Start propagation of MobiusConfig values on reconfigure
 - fix the function lists to use CSV rather than StringList
   - set flags directly on the Functions
   


Since we no longer use Parameter for the UI, and have moved bindings up
is there any need for the old getHigh, getOrdinalLabel, etc?  Weed them.
Unless scripts need them.

Sure would be nice to  factor Action and Export handling out of them so
we could share the model.


Go over the stuff in new and see what was used
