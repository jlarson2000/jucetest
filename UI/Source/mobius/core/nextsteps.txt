Not seeing frame advance during Record
After Reset, getting NPE in setup->isResetable(MapParameter...
  MapParameter is a stub but it might not work anyway
  if isResetable just does a substring search on the parameter name
  can just pass the name without mapping
  faster to have this flag set on Parameter during config propagation

setup::resetables has the StringList problem.  If we convet to StringList
at runtime, then the conversion has to be done in Shell
since this flag is only releant to core, set it on Parameter not UIParameter

Need a default set of resetables if not defined in Setup
  - should this be global and overridden in Setup?





Since we no longer use Parameter for the UI, and have moved bindings up
is there any need for the old getHigh, getOrdinalLabel, etc?  Weed them.
Unless scripts need them.

Sure would be nice to  factor Action and Export handling out of them so
we could share the model.


Go over the stuff in new and see what was used
