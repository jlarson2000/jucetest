Flesh out LayerElement, fix AudioMeter for input add smaller
AudioMeter for track strip output

   - set flags directly on the Functions
   


Since we no longer use Parameter for the UI, and have moved bindings up

Unless scripts need them.

Sure would be nice to  factor Action and Export handling out of them so
we could share the model.


Go over the stuff in new and see what was used
