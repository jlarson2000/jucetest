 * 
 * A set of classes that implement an object pooling system with
 * coordination between an appication thread and an device interrupt handler.
 * 
 * NOTE: This is general, consider moving to util.
 *
 * The object pool will be accessed from two contexts:
 *
 *    Maintenance Thread - an application thread that runs periodically to 
 *      perform pool maintenance
 *
 *    Interrupt - an device interrupt that runs continually 
 *
 * The interrupt is expected to be able to retrieve and return 
 * objects from the pool instantly, without a critical section
 * crossing where possible.  The pool thread is expected to keep
 * the pool full of objects so the interrupt handler will never starve.
 *
 * An object pool maintains two linked lists and two ring buffers.
 * 
 *   Allocation Ring
 *     A ring buffer of pooled objects available to the interrupt.
 *     The interrupt handler will remove objects from the tail of the ring,
 *     the pool thread will add objects to the head of the ring.
 *
 *   Allocation List
 *     A list of pooled objects that the pool thread may add to the
 *     allocation ring.  The allocation ring is of fixed size and may not
 *     be large enough to hold all of the pooled objects that have ever
 *     been allocated.  When an object is freed and the ring buffer is full,
 *     it "overflows" to the allocation list.  When the pool thread
 *     needs to add something to the allocation ring, it first uses
 *     objects from the allocation list, then allocates new objects.
 *
 *   Free Ring
 *     A ring buffer of pooled objects available to be reclaimed.
 *     The interrupt handler will add objects to the head of the ring.
 *     The pool thread will remove objects from the tail of the ring.
 *     Objects removed from the tail will be placed back on the
 *     head of the allocation ring if it is not full, otherwise on
 *     the allocation list.
 *
 *   Free List
 *     A list of objects ready to be put on the free ring by the interrupt
 *     handler.  Like the allocation ring, the free ring is not necessarily
 *     large enough to hold all objects that have ever been allocated.  If the
 *     free ring is full when the interrupt handler frees an object, 
 *     it will be added to the free list.  The interrupt handler will
 *     periodically check to see if space is available on the free ring
 *     and move the free list objects to the ring.
 *
 * Only the pool thread is allowed to touch the allocation list, the head
 * of the allocation ring, and the tail of the free ring.
 *
 * Only the interrupt handler is allowed to touch the free list, the head
 * of the free ring, and the tail of the allocation ring.
 * 
 * A pool may decide not to return objects in the free list to the
 * free ring, and instead allocate directly from the free list.  This
 * requires slighthly less overhead than a ring allocation, and a freed
 * object will available immediately without waiting for the maintenance
 * thread to move it from the free ring to the allocation ring.
 * This is useful for most small objects that are allocated and freed
 * frequently.  
 *
 * The free ring is useful for very large objects such as audio buffers.
 * Since the free list is "owned" by the interrupt handler and the 
 * interrupt handler is not allowed to return objects to the heap, 
 * everything on the free list will remain allocated for the lifetime
 * of the application.  If large buffers are allowed to accumulate, 
 * the memory size of the process will steadily increase.  This is not
 * necessarily a bad thing, but may lead to increased paging.  Instead,
 * the interrupt may periodically return buffers to the free ring
 * (such as after a GlobalReset), and the maintenance thread may
 * then choose to return them to the heap rather than accumulating
 * them on the allocation list.
 *
 * Some pooled objects, notably Audio objects, contain a hierarchy
 * of other objects which may also be pooled.  The interrupt handler
 * will usually pool the root Audio object, not each of the audio buffers
 * maintained within the Audio object.  The audio buffers will be returned
 * to the pool when the pool thread reclaims the Audio object.
 *
 * This means that there are two contexts in which an object may be returned
 * to the allocation list: indirectly by the interrupt handler via
 * the free ring, or directly by the pool thread if the object is inside
 * another pooled object.
 * 
 * The Object Pool Manager is a singleton that maintains multiple
 * object pools.  The interrupt handler may retain pointers to the
 * object pools, so once they have been initialized they must not be freed
 * as long as it is possible to have interrupts.
