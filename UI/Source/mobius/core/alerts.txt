Need a way to display important warning messages to the user.

A popup alert is traditinal but in a performance situation that can get in the way.

For anything that needs to be said in a performance situation, things from the engine
that are not fatal, a temporary error message that displays then times out and goes away
would be nice.

Could collect those in an "error log" that can be shwon with a manu item.

A file based error collector would be very nice once this starts getting out
to users.  If something seems weird I can ask them to send me the logs.

This would be in addition to the trace log, something that is always there, and
starts pruning after it gets to a certain size.
