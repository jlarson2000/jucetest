exports were added for OSC which we can redesign

replace with the Query concept or reuse the old code, but get
it the fuck out of here

Unfortunately Export is part of the core model for Scripts, it is how
we get the value of Parameters, this will take thought

It's also how doParameter gets the value when using operators...
