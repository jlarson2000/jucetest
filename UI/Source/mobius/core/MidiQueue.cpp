 * 
 * Classes used to accumulate MIDI realtime events and 
 * maintain transport status (started, stopped, beat, etc.)
 *
 * This was designed for use by the Mobius synchronizer but parts
 * of it are relatively general.  Could consider moving some of
 * it to the midi library.
 *
 * In between audio interrupts, MIDI events that are received
 * are placed in a ring buffer in the MidiQueue.
 *
 * During the audio interrupt Synchronizer will call MidiQueue.getEvents
 * to determine which queued events should be processed in this
 * interrupt and what they're buffer offsets will be.
 *
 * Event objects are returned  with one of these SyncType values:
 *
 *     SYNC_TYPE_START
 *     SYNC_TYPE_STOP
 *     SYNC_TYPE_CONTINUE
 *     SYNC_TYPE_PULSE
 *
 * When SyncType is SYNC_TYPE_CONTINUE the Event will also contain
 * a ContinueClock.
 *
 * When SyncType is SYNC_TYPE_PULSE, the Event will also contain
 * a SyncUnit value:
 *
 *     SYNC_UNIT_MIDI_CLOCK
 *     SYNC_UNIT_MIDI_BEAT
