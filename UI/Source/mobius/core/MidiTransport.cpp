 * 
 * A class managing coordination between a MIDI output device
 * and the millisecond timer to provide a higher level "transport"
 * abstraction for generating MIDI realtime events.
 *
 * Designed for use with the Synchronizer, it could be used elsewhere
 * except that we have a dependency on Event.
 *
 * When Synchronizer is constructed it will create one MidiTransport.
 * The MidiTransport is given the MidiInterface that was given
 * to Synchronizer by Mobius.  MidiTransport will register itself
 * as the MidiClockListener for the MidiInterface.  Thereafter it
 * will receive notification each time the timer thread encapsulated
 * within MidiInterface sends an MS_CLOCK, MS_START, MS_STOP, 
 * or MS_CONTINUE event.
 *
 * Inside we manage a MidiQueue object and forward MidiEvents to it.
 * MidiQueue handles the semantics of the event stream including whether
 * we are started or stopped, the song position,  and when we've
 * received enough clocks to make a MIDI "beat".  
 *
 * During the audio interrupt Synchronizer will call MidiTransport.getEvents
 * to convert the raw MIDI events received into a list of Event objects
 * to be processed.  Event objects will have one of these SyncType values:
 *
 *     SYNC_TYPE_START
 *     SYNC_TYPE_STOP
 *     SYNC_TYPE_CONTINUE
 *     SYNC_TYPE_PULSE
 *
 * When SyncType is SYNC_TYPE_CONTINUE the Event will also contain
 * a ContinueClock.
 *
 * When SyncType is SYNC_TYPE_PULSE, the Event will also contain
 * a SyncUnit value:
 *
 *     SYNC_UNIT_MIDI_CLOCK
 *     SYNC_UNIT_MIDI_BEAT
 *
 * The SyncTracker for the MIDI clock generator will watch clock pulses.
 * The distinction between CLOCK and BEAT is only important when 
 * quantizing the start of a recording and when rounding it off.
