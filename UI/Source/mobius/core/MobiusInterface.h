 * The primary public interface include for the Mobius engine.

 * of stuff that needs to be accessible internally by function handlers
 * and I wanted to make the interface for the UI and plugin hosts
 * clearer.  This interface should be used by anything on the "outside"
 * that is hosting the mobius looping engine including the Mobius UI, 
 * host plugin adapters, OSC message handlers, MIDI event handlers.
