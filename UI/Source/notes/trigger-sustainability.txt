TriggerUI could be sustainable or not
  if we assume sustainable, then each action button needs a unique id
    could be the ordinal of it's location in the button list
  if we allow selective sustain on some buttons but not others
    still need unique ids if sustainable, but if not sustainable
    an completely skip trigger tracking

Unclear whether host bindings should be sustainable or not.  Since they're
ultimately just moving a CC from 127 to zero, it could do that, but not all host
parameters behave that way so it would need to be a binding setting.

Action->id is only necessary for sustainable triggers with sustainable targets
  if either of those is false, then we will never track this trigger
  and it won't need an id

The system must make no assumptions about what trigger->id means, it's just a unique number

TriggerState in action is the only thing that cares about this

May need a binding option if a source in general can be sustainable (UI Button) but
each binding is different.

Still don't like that some functions have SUS variants.  If you bind a SUS function
to a trigger that can't be sustained, then it should behave like the non-SUS variant.

However, if you bind a non-SUS function to a sustainable trigger, it doesn't mean
it can BECOME a SUS function.  That would have to be added in the binding.  which
is nice because it means we can get rid of SUS functions.  Part of the function
definition is "is sustainable".  Meaning it can be sustained but doesn't have to.
the decision is left to the binding.  and the option to make the binding sustainaned
tests "is sustainable" to even offer that option.
