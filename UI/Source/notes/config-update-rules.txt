There is WAY too much complexity around incremental updates to MobiusConfig
while the engine is running

need to only do certain things like installing scripts in a state of Global Reset
because of the ResolvedTargets

scripts are hard anyway because there can be live Actions/Events/ScriptInterpreters
using the current model

this whole history nonsense is related to that

Make installScripts be a function that must be invoked by the UI, like installSamples?
  nice to allow this to be done without interaction, can at least limit it to global reset

Global Reset needs to
  put everything into a quiet initialized state
  remove all the fucking ResolvedTargets and make it start over
