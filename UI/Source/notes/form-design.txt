Needs

field has a label, a widget, and holds a value
  value may be an int, bool, string, or enumeration
  value may be multi-valued, only need this for enumerations but could for others?
    yes will need it for arbitrary lists of strings
  use it for others as an alternative to lists of checkboxes?
     eg:
        foo x
        bar x
     vs
        box with foo, bar that can be individually highlighted
        I have these in a few places, sustain functions
        
  field does not know where the value came from
  field has an optional render type to override default rules
  field is constructed before the rendered Component model
  dependencies between fields needs to be worked out, keep this
    at a higher level
    will require field listeners

  let fields be subclassed to add specialized initialization and processing behavior
    ParameterField

field set
  displays a list of vertical fields
  may have multiple columns
  renders container components, and then the field components within them
  could be generalized into a more flexible layout manager
  field labels are right aligned, field widgets are left aligned within a row
  alt: form
  
field organizer
  maintains multiple field sets but only displays one at a time
  typically uses tabs to display selected field sets
  alternately could use a select box to select sets
  alt: form group

action field
  do we need these?
  typically a button that calls out to something that can make adjustments to
  fields, "Capture" for setup fields is one
  might be better to promote this to the panel that manages the fields





panel that displays a list of vertical fields
panel that displays multiple lists of fields in columns




----------------------------------------------------------------------

Field
  renders a single labeled value
  selects component based on type
  some fields may have user defined values and be of variable length
    preset names, setup names

RangeField
  longer numeric field using a knob or slider

MultiSelect
  a parameter may have any number of a possible set of values
  example: sustain functions
  option 1
    value list with individual item highlighting
  option 2
    dual panel with arrows to move values between them
    a complex component that differs from others
      wide and has a top label rather than a side label
  option 3
    checkbox grid
    simpler and in some ways more obvious
    limited height without scrolling
    would work for sustain functions


boolean
  several options, checkbox, multiselect, toggle button
  juce ToggleButton already has support for a label on the right
  juce TextButton can be toggles with different text when selected
  
Form
  organizes fields
  can have multiple tab panels
  may want to promote this to a higher level for tabs and
  let forms just organize fields
  fields can be single or dual columns
  

Field views
  example: the track selection radios
  selection changes the values displayed in a common set of fields

Form Commands
  buttons that can do things within the form without closing the form
  example: track setup initialize, capture


Form Tabs
  most configuration forms will have several tab panels


---

Form Section
  could draw a ring around a set of fields
  could use to organize fields into columns?
    more complex than we need

Liking the notion of a simple block of vertical fields as a component,
have this in other places like binding panels that are more complex than
tabbed field sets

User List
  a list of values that are completely variable
  example: script list
  like a text area but with guided value selection
    - currently use a file chooser
  items can be selected and deleted

---

FieldPanel
  a collection of usually simple fields arranged in one or more columns

Object Editor
  used to edit objects that can be of variable number and have names
  has components for naming and renaming the object and selecting
  one of the objects to be active
  has button to delete the object

  example: preset, setup, midi bindings

  other parameter sets don't currently have multiple objects but could be nice
    buttons, colors, etc.

---

Config Panel
  title at the top, save/cancel buttons at the bottom, arbitrary content in the middle

Juce TabbedComponent displays the tab bar and manages visibility of a content component

Juce TabbedButtonBar can be used independently of TabbedComponent

Start with Field and FieldSet
