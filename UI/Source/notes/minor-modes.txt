The old UI has a thin rectangle on the display named "Minor Modes" that must
just display all the active minor modes.  Will need that at some point.
The UI for minor modes has them all hard coded:

		marker = ReverseMode->getDisplayName();
        ...
		marker = CaptureMode->getDisplayName();

        tstate->speedToggle != mSpeedToggle ||
		tstate->speedOctave != mSpeedOctave ||
		tstate->speedStep != mSpeedStep ||

That are taken from track members

    s->speedToggle = mSpeedToggle;
    s->speedOctave = mInput->getSpeedOctave();
    s->speedStep = mInput->getSpeedStep();
    s->speedBend = mInput->getSpeedBend();
    s->pitchOctave = mInput->getPitchOctave();
    s->pitchStep = mInput->getPitchStep();
    s->pitchBend = mInput->getPitchBend();
    s->timeStretch = mInput->getTimeStretch();
	s->reverse = mInput->isReverse();

might be nice for minor modes in TrackState to just be a csv so we don't need
special code every time we add/remove one

these could be placed in a modestly sized static array
