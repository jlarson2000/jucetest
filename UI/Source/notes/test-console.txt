Thoughts on an external command line console or test application that
can send actions to the engine or make the UI do things

Digression: Test Console
  the UI is driven entirely from MobiusState except for the action buttons
  the test console can activte an alternative MobiusState used instead of the real one
  test console takes commands to change the alternate MobiusState
    set track 4 frame 1000

  interesting but too much work, still, think about how many automated test
  scripts could be done ABOVE the core
