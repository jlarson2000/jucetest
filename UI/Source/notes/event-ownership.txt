As typical with Events, there is the confusing notion of "owned" that
is set in a few cases to prevent it from being returned to a pool.

This happens only for special synchronization related events that are
generated automatically and reused.  Two that I can find

Synchronizer::mReturnEvent
EventManager::mSyncEvent

These are both created outside a pool so the mPool pointer will be null
They also both set the owned flag

It seems like we don't need both, ownership is implied by not having a pool

added some trace messages to detect when they are not in sync so to speak
