This is complicated and not well documented

The general rule seems to be to add child components first

then call setSize()

setSize results in a cascading resized() calls to the child components
which is how layout seems to be done

unclear the extent to which components can ignore the downward trickling sizes

when messing around with complex component ordering with subclasses and whatnot,
be careful not to call setSize too soon or too often

prefer setSize on the topmost compents when the component tree is more-or-less done
