would like panels to do two things

  - automatically size themselves based on content
  - track Components that need to be freed
  - Juce does not automatically delete child components since
    they are often member objects
  - would be nice if it could automatically make things visible


Since Panel is directly a Juce component addChildComponent and
addAndMakeVisible can still be called for untracked objects

Give it addOwnedChild

  play with giving children a visible flag before we add them so don't
  have to call addAndMakeVisible?

Sizing options
  deferred
     add various children
     must call panel->autoSize
  automatic
    after ever child is added call autoSize
    requires overloading the base Component child methods

autoSize might be nice to call once at the top level and have it recurse?
  - requires dynamic cast and an AutoSizeable interface
