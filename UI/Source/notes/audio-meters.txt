Had a very basic output level meter before

    this was in the track strip and displayed output level of the track
    if (mLevel != NULL)
      mLevel->setValue(tstate->outputMonitorLevel);

This was a display component that measured input level

	mMeter = new AudioMeter();
    mMeter->setEnabled(false);
	mSpace->add(mMeter);
    
            mMeter->update(tstate->inputMonitorLevel);

So we need two things from MobiusState


These are both in MobiusTrackState

I think since tracks can receive from any port, so you only
want to monitor what the active track is receiving

These were set here:

	s->outputMonitorLevel = mOutput->getMonitorLevel();
    if (isSelected())
      s->inputMonitorLevel = mInput->getMonitorLevel();
	else
	  s->inputMonitorLevel = 0;

those were streams

	mInput = new InputStream(sync, m->getSampleRate());
	mOutput = new OutputStream(mInput, m->getAudioPool());

seems to still be working:

int OutputStream::getMonitorLevel()
{
	// convert to 16 bit integer
	return (int)(mMaxSample * 32767.0f);
}
