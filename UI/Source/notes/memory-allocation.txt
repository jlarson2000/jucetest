Area where core code is doing memory allocation that need to be fixed.

Any config parameter that uses StringList
Need to use CSVs consnstently.

Any config parameter that uses const char* and allows the value
to be set from scripts.

Mobius::installScripts
  allocates a temporary ScriptCompiler

GENERAL PROBLEM - multiple plugin instances

  See words in Mobius::initFunctions
  there may be issues with multiple plugin instances share the same
  static data objects, which was apparently a problem for the Function array
  when we wanted to dynamically extend it for scripts.

  We don't really need multiple instances, but it can happen and we should be
  graceful about it.

  This also argues against using the static objects to hold runtime changes like
  "resettable" flags.

Mobius::initFunctions
  allocates an array to hold Function pointers combining the static Function objects
  with objects representing scripts

  needs redesign for several reasons

Mobius::updateGlobalFunctionPreferences
  stuff related to focus configuration and shared static objects between plugin instances

Mobius::loadProject, loadProjectInternal
  deletes the Project after loading
  load/save needs a complete overhaul

Mobius::saveProject
  old assumptions about this being above the interrupt which no longer apply
  there was concern about this taking too much time which is still valid

Mobius::internTarget

Mobius::newAction
  everything surrounding how Actions work needs to be redesigned
  if we need to allocate an "interned" model, this needs to be done in Shell and phased down

Track::copyPreset

SetupNameParameterType
  setCurrentSetup
  now setActiveSetup
  allocates a new name with CopyString
  not really a reason this has to be a string, could use ordinal
  except it looks obscure in XML
  also SetupNumberParameterType

MobiusConfig::setActiveSetup
  see todo
