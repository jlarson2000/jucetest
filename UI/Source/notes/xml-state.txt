Rathering than having a complex command line or UI to simulate
MobiusState can use an XML file with a sparse representation of the
state and import it.  Once imported it redirects the dsisplay to get
state from there:

<state>
  <track>  // defaults to active track
    <loop>  // defauls to active loop
      <layer>


most flexible, gives you complete model control

but what you really want is more command-ish

<LayerInfo undo='16' redo='5' checkpoint='2,4'/>

Conceptually I want to say:

    track 2, loop 2, undo 16, redo 5

means

   make track 2 active, loop 2 active, and build the layer model

could make this really concise

  2/1/16/5

or

  2/1/...C...X...

that's all you need for layer testing, it's a "loop spec"

Yeah, don't need a blown out XML model for MobiusState, come up
with the most concise shorthand

loops are more complicated becasuse they have a lot of state
how about making this more like a linear script

track 1    // target track 1

// set things about the selected track
preset XYX
inputMonitorLevel 200
feedback 64
...

loop 2  // target loop 2 in track 1

layers ...C...X...
