TriggerState
  called by Mobius::doFunction
    mTriggerState->assimilate(a);
    
  called near the end of beginAudioInterrupt
    // Advance the long-press tracker too, this may cause other 
    // actions to fire.
    mTriggerState->advance(this, mInterruptStream->getInterruptFrames());

   has a TriggerWatcher but only used internally

TriggerState::assimilate
  if up transition
    look for a TriggerWatcher for the given action
    sets the action->longPress to whether the watcher had the flag set
            // convey long press state in the action
            action->longPress = tw->longPress;

    so an Action comes in, we check to see if a down was being tracked and
      if the watcher thinks it is long, set the longPress flag

  if down transition
    remove watcher previously saved for this action
    allocates a new watcher from the pool and adds it to the watch list

TriggerState::remove
  looks at all the watcher for one with
    matching matching trigger type
    matching trigger ID
      - this is the magic id we need for TriggerMidi, it has to be a unique
        combo of channel/note


Trigger::advance
  advances a frame count, looks at all watcher to see if they've been
  held down for mLongPressFrames
  if long detected
    allocates a NEW action and sets it with stuff saved in the watcher
    remembers track/group too,
    calls Mobius::doAction

So the key parts are automatically generating Actions at the start of
each interrupt if we've noticed a long press.  Moving this out will require
an alternative timer.  Since long press is in the 1 second or more range the
1/10th UI interval would be enough.

This can be moved to Binderator
  from the engine perspective an Action comes in and we do whatever it does
  time passes, an auto-generated Action comes in to start something new
  original Action may be gone, or still on the event list, I guess the Function
  is responsible for correlating scheduled Actions and doing something with them
  if it hasn't happened yet, could change the event
  could do this entirely in the UI but it isn't that complicated


What is sensitive to action->longPress
  Mobius calls doActionNow
  Mobius doFunction calls f->invokeLong rather than f->invoke
  on up transition doFunction cal f->invoke on a DIFFERENT function
    for cases where a long changes the ending

This has a lot of subtle EDPisms in it that I think need to belong in the engine
It isn't just long detection in the tracker, it's what happens if longPress is
set in the Action.  That can't be moved, but tracking mechanism could.  Still there
are some subtle conventions about what an Action created by the long press watcher
looks like, this could be a different Trigger type?

Keep this in core for now it isn't that bad.


----------------------------------------------------------------------


Long press has been done by measuring the time a key has been held down and
submitting a new Action to represent the activation of long press behavior.

Tracking long-press does not have to be done in core, it could be done at any level
all the way up to Binderator, provided that it receives regular Timer events.

If done above, Core receives a UIAction as lormal with the "long" flag set.

This is in effect a "trigger argument".  Does it make sense to generalize trigger
arguments like we do for arguments.

   Function SelectLoop 2

2 is an action argument.  The Action is Function, the name is Select Loop and
the argument is 2

   Function Record long

It's kind of the same, it adjusts the interpretation of the Record function.

If the UI tracks this, it needs to know which actions support long behavior
so that it doesn't bother sending long Actions for things that don't need them.

This can be a flag on the Function:  isLongable, isLongPress

The UI probably can't know what the side effects of a long press are:

    Record long = Reset

Or can it?

Long Record becoming Reset is easy

Long Something becomming SUS Something should be easy for most.

This would actually be a great way to do SUS, in most cases anything can be SUSsable
without needing different Functions for it.

The weird ones are SUSUnroundedMultiply.

Yes, this deserves thought.  In a binding definition a trigger can have
these configurations.

     OnPress:  Record
     OnLong:   Reset
     OnRelease: nothing

     OnPress: Overdub
     OnRelese: Overdub
       - effectively SUSOverdub

It's the ones that change fundamental behavior after long that are strange.  The engine is
going to need to be informed when this happens beyond just sending an alternate action
without context.  So still need the "long" flag which may or may not be ignored.

   OnPress: Record
   OnLong: notify  (means to send Record again with long flag)
     - let's the engine implement what long Record means, what we have now

Interesting and flexible.  Gets the engine out of the business of hard coding what long and sus
mean.

  Reminder: The engine should not need to know what triggers are, only what Actions they
  wanted.  Exception may be for Script triggers, but that's internal and can be included
  in the Action.  Same for Event, or internally generated actions.

  The "action context".  When does the source of an action matter?

First step is to get the tracking of long press out of the engine.  The side effects
of long can still be in there, but gradually work those up.

Start thinkig about "marker" actions.  Initiation simply defines a frame offset to start
something, similar to a Mode.  Ending performs a function from the start marker forward.
