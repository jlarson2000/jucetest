 * 
 * A model for defining bindings between external triggers like MIDI,
 * keyboard, and OSC events with Mobius targets like functions and
 * parameters.  This model is only for the definitions of the bindings
 * and is persisted in mobius.xml.  At runtime we build the 
 * Action model which is transient.  
 * 
 * The relevant classes are:
 *
 *   Trigger				constant objects for triggers
 *   Target					constant object for targets
 *   Bindable				abstract class for bindable config objects
 *   Binding				trigger, target, bindable
 *   BindingConfig 			collection of Bindings
 *
 * OLD MODEL
 *
 * Before BindingConfig we used MidiConfig which was funtionally
 * similar but only supported MIDI bindings.  We keep this model
 * around in OldBinding.* so that we can parse old XML config files
 * anc convert it to the new BindingConfig model.  This is done
 * in Mobius::loadConfiguration.
 *
 * MobiusConfig
 *   MidiConfig				now BindingConfig
 *     MidiBinding			now Binding
 * 
 * ===
 * 
 * A binding is composed of three main parts: Trigger, Target, and Scope.
 *
 * The binding triggers are:
 *
 *    Key - a key on the computer keyboard, may include shift qualifiers
 *    Note - a MIDI note
 *    Controller - a MIDI continuous controller
 *    Program - a MIDI program change
 *    Host - a parameter automation event from a plugin host
 *    UI - a button in the user interface
 *    Mouse - a button on the mouse or alternate input device
 *    Wheel - the scroll wheel of a mouse or input device
 *            don't like this in retrospect, use wheel for changing the
 *            selected UI element
 *
 * Mouse and Wheel are defined but not currently used.
 *
 * In addition we also define these trigger types for various internal
 * triggers, these cannot be dynamically bound to targets with a
 * Binding object, binding is either implicit or done with a different
 * kind of configuration object.
 *
 *    Script - an executing script (only for calling functions)
 *    Alert - an interesting engine state is reached (always bound to scripts)
 *
 * The binding targets are:
 *
 *    Function - a Mobius function, may have selector argument
 *    Parameter - A Global, Preset,  track parameter, or control
 *    Setup - a Setup configuration object
 *    Preset - a Preset configuration object
 *    Bindings - a BindingConfig configuration object
 *    UI Control - a UI control (cursor up/down, value up/down)
 *
 * The binding scopes are:
 *
 *   Global 
 *     No specific track assignment, applied to the current track and
 *     any track with focus lock or in the same group as the selected track.
 *
 *   Track
 *     A specific track number is included in the binding.  Only that
 *     track is affected.
 *
 *   Group
 *     A specific group number is included in the binding.  All tracks
 *     in that group are affected.

 * Defines a binding between a trigger and a target.

 *
 * OSC bindings were added later, need to revisit the design and consider
 * using "paths" consistently everywhere rather than breaking it down
 * into discrete target/name/scope/args, at least not in the persistent model.
 *
 * Scope started out as a pair of track and group numbers but now
 * it is string whose value is a scope name with these conventions:
 *
 *    null - a global binding (current track, focused tracks, group tracks)
 *    digit - track number
 *    letter - group identifier (A,B,C...)
 *
 * In theory we can add other scopes like "muted", simliar to the
 * track identifiers we have with the "for" statement in scripts.
 * 
 * There is usually a number associated with the trigger.
 *   Note - note number
 *   Program - program number 
 *   Control - control number
 *   Key - key code
 *   Wheel - NA
 *   Mouse - ?
 *   Host - host parameter number
 *
 * MIDI triggers may have an additional channel number.
 *
 * Some Targets may have an additional numeric argument.
 *   - only functions like Track ?
 *
 * OSC bindings use targetPath instead of discrete target, name, scope, 
 * and arguments values.  This will be parsed into the discrete values.
 * OSC bindings also have a string value (the source method) rather than
 * a simple integer like MIDI notes.  This is only used when Bindings
