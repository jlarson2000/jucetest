We have two major varieties: docked and floating

The docked strips appear at the bottom and there will always
be one for each configured track

The default docked strip contains
  Track Number
  Loop Radar
  Loop Status
  Output Level
  Output Level Meter

The optional dock elements are
  Focus Lock
  Group Name
  Input Level
  Feedback, Secondary Feedback, Pan,
  Speed Octave, Step, Bend
  Pitch Octave, Step, Bend
  Time Stretch
  Loop Meter

Of the optionals the only really useful ones are Group Name
Loop Meter is an alternative to radar that takes up less space

The floating track strips can contain the same things, could
add "floating" and "docked" flags to simplify the options.

Could allow any number of floaters.

So we've got a new container/child concept like StatusArea

TrackStrip
  contains StripElements
  may be floating or docked
  floating are also StatusElements or else need a StatusElement wrapper
    - kind of like the wrapper for config and dragging

A track strip currently displays the elements in a vertical column.
  - could add support for multiple columns but that complicates docking
  - better just to use multiple floaters for this

Will need SystemConstant objects to define both element lists for config
but can hard code them for now

Will want to allow the standalone Mobius window to be resized while playing
with these since you can't squash status area elements.  Docked track strip
will always be of fixed height.
