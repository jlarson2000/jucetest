Logical and concrete model notes after much internal discussion
This file represents the latest thinking on this and supercedes the
innumerable thought capture file that are strewn around.

Trigger
  external stimulus that causes something to happen

Operation
  what you want to happen

Destination
  where you want it to go

Properties
  named values on the definitions of triggers, operations, and destinations
  part of the logical model used when talking about these things
  and may be in a concrete model for defining those things


Triggers have types
  keyboard, midi, UI, osc

Each Trigger type has additional properties
  key, note number, program number, etc.


Operations have types
  function, parameter, activation

All operations have a name property
  function name, parameter name, activation type (preset, setup, bindingSet)

Opertions may have a required value
  parameter value, activation structure type, destination object number (e.g. track number)

Each operation type may have additional properties
  parameter value range, function arguments, trigger restrictions (sustainable)
  activation structure name

Operations may have arguments
  arbitrary for functions and parameters, none for activations


Destinations are fundamentally complex paths to things on which to perform operations

Destinations can be specific (targeting one thing) or collective (targeting multiple things)

Destinations are broadly divided into two categories
  ui, engine

Scope is a concrete model for specifying destinations in the engine
  active, track, group


Structures
  - collections of values that may be Activated
  - values may have concrete definitons as Parameters or may
    just be internal control variables
  - structures may have multiples in which case they must have a name

Binding
  an association between a trigger, operation, and destination
