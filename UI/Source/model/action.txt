move the Button model back to Binings
  consistent with MIDI and OSC which will have their own
  binding managers
  simplifies all the BindingPanels

Binding has everything in it to identify a target

Action is crated from a Binding
  all the same state plus
    - resolved name references to SystemConstant objects
    - parsed arguments
    - trigger information


Old model adds a lot of runtime processing state which we don't want out here
Will require copying from UIAction to a larger object
  more overhead but results in a much cleaner control flow and lifespan management

Old model stored target resolution down to internal objects
  must not have that in UI model, but could provide an opaque pointer
  to the action be annotated by the engine if it really saves any time

UI doesn't have to worry about object pooling since the Actions will
managed by a binder object.  For buttons, the ActionButton, for MIDI
the MIDIDispatcher

Buttons are unusual because we have a concrete model to hang the Actions
MIDI doesn't have that so the dispatcher will need to keep them in a table
