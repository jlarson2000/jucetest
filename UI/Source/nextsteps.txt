UIParameter and UIFunction generator

add scope='ui' for UI specific parameters and functions
  don't necessarily need get/set for these

weed UIAction

ModeDefininition
  - need this out here?
  - MobiusState track/loop/mode
  - ui/display/ModeElement - displays the state value
     only really need a string here
     rename this UIMode?
  - Simulator puts it in state

UIEventType
  - duplication of EventType because it's in MobiusState
  


Go over the model
  - clean separation between UI and internal class names
     UIParameter vs. Parameter
     UIFunction vs. Function
     conflict beween using UI to mean "part of the UI model" and "something in
     the UI model that targets something managed by the UI"
       - solve this with Op and scope
       OpActivation can reference a UI structure
       scope='ui' refers to something implemented in the UI
       
     The UIFunction nextParameter has target='UI' and would not be implemented by engine
       - now it has OpFunction scope='ui'
     but when we talk about UIfunctions, sometimes we mean "functions that can only
       have TargetUI
      Ext makes this a little clearer, you have ExtFunction meaning part of the external
      model

- remove old internal junk
  still need to weed UIAction, take out all OSC for now
