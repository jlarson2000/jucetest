Go over the model
  - clean separation between UI and internal class names
     UIParameter vs. Parameter
     UIFunction vs. Function
     conflict beween using UI to mean "part of the UI model" and "something in
     the UI model that targets something managed by the UI"
     The UIFunction nextParameter has target='UI' and would not be implemented by
      the engine
      but when we talk about UIfunctions, sometimes we mean "functions that can only
      have TargetUI
      Ext makes this a little clearer, you have ExtFunction meaning part of the external
      model
  - remove old internal junk
