Currently there can be multiple BindingConfig objects
with different sets of keyboard and MIDI bindings
There is only one UIConfig which is where the UIButton bindings live

if we merge these then if you create a new BindingConfig you
will lose all the buttons which is probably not what you want

Binding configs really only make sense for MIDI if you want to swap
between controllers.

You can also just add mulitple controllers in a single config if you
make sure they use different MIDI keys and controller numbers.  That's
what I would normaally do.

key bindings make less sense to swap out, once you set those up
you always want them, in effect it is like a MIDI controller that never goes away
and there can only be one of

I suppose you might want different key bindings for different machines, like
desktop vs. laptop but that is unlikely

For testing, it makes more sense to have different button sets.
You might want buttons to test certain things or run certain scripts.

For testing, it is not as likely to want different key or MIDI bindings.

so key bindings never change, button bindings change only for testing
and MIDI bindinds don't NEED to change unless you're swapping a lot of controllers

Compare this with binding overlays, that was originally intended
for different controllers.  but could also be used for buttons


Yes this gets you there, for bindings there is always a single "base" binding
set that for almost everyone has everything.

If you want to add test buttons add an overlay
If you have controllers with overlapping MIDI events make several overlays and
either keep those events out of the base bindings or let the overlay overwrite them.

that works for keys too though I don't need them

it CAN make sense to have multiple UI configurations, to change the layouts of things
but this would be independent of bindings

So yes, keep bidnings in one place and use overlays

Eventually allow multiple UIConfigs but these won't contain bindings
