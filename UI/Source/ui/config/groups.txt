The number of possible groups is configured in MobiusConfig

Groups cannot currently be named, the UI will auto generate
generate names "Group A", "Group B", etc.

Engine does not need to know anything about groups other than just the number

Groups only really relevant for binding propagation, UIAction can carry the
group number, but it's just as easy for the UI to replicate them and give them
track scope.

Scripts need to know group numbers for iteration

for group 1

could allow scripts to reference groups symbolicially

for group "Bass"

If the UI replicates group actions then we need to dynamically allocate them
So while the binding has group 1, when MobiusInterface is called
it will need several actions copied from the main, and often static action,

Since the engine always copies information out of the UIAction, it can be deleted
right away or we can pool them.

Unsure if scripts need to do this group replication, when a track is
targeted with for, I think that alwayas ends up replicating with internal Actions
allocated from the pool.
