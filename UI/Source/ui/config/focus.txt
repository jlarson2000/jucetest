Focus thoughts

Focus is currently ad-hoc, you tell the track if it has focus lock
or is a group member and the bindings automatically go there.

Binding scope can override this to target specific groups or tracks.

If we can scope down to single tracks, why not multiple?  Groups are
just a symbolic name for multiple.

Focus lock functions gives you control over which functions are focused or not.
But is this global or more like binding scope.

scope=active
  the active track, default
  
scope=focused
  any track with focus lock

scope=group
  any track in the group

scope=track
  specific track

scope=track1,track2
  set of tracks

scope=track1-track4
  range of tracks
  often done in scripts

Focus lock functions gives control over which functions implicitily obey scope=focused
so you don't have to specify that in the bindings.  If we don't have that then
you duplicate the focus scope in each binding, e.g. need one for both keyboard and MIDI.

This could be combined.  The effective scope for a binding is
  - explicitly specified scope, ignores focus lock functions
  - default scope, looks at focus lock functions

I like this, focus lock is relatively obscure and it should be off by default
and you have to think about it before you start focusing tracks.

Focus lock is really just a special unnamed group.  This can be generalized into a set
of focus buttons per-track for each configured group.  Rather than a track always be in
a group you can select all the groups the track is in on the fly.

Yes liking this.  You can have several bindings for the same Function with different scopes.






 * Might be intersting to have a binding option to ignore focus.
 * This would eliminate the need for Focus Lock Functions.
 * Think: is focus somethign relatively static you would want to capture
 * in the binding, or is it more ad-hoc.
