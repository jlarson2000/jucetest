Modal dialogs in general are bad for plugins, and you can't even get
to juce::AlertWindow::show..  functions for modal dialogs because
they're compiled out.

Can find a way to put those in for standalone, but they're not allowed
for plugins so don't bother.

Better to have "alerts" just be normal components and use flags
to simulate modality in whatever config editor you're using.

It's hard to prevent you from continuing to interact with components
underneath the window, but it's not that bad since you would normally
want to dismiss the alert popup asap.

Would be nice to reuse some of the presentation graphics though.

Simpler is just to have a label near whatever caused it that
can optionally display red text, and use a Timer to make it go away
after awhile.
