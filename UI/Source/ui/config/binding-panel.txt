There are three binding panels

  Buttons
  Keyboard
  MIDI
  Host/Plugin Parameters
  
liking moving BindingConfig to the UI since it is entirely a UI level implementation
makes it easier to have it in UIConfig

OscBindingSet also uses Binding, but I'm not ready to merge that yet

Things in old Mobius that used Binding not directly in the UI

ActionDispatcher
  I think related to selecting the overlay bindings
  this can move to the UI
  there will always be a set of bindings specific to the UI

BindingResolver
  resolved things to Track and probably Preset and Setup
  still need something like this but can work differently

ControlSurface
  never finished, but also completely UI

Export
  kind of in between engine and UI

MobiusState
  had the set of overlay bindings in it, but this doesn't have to be there
  move to UIConfig

Parameter
  references to getBindingHigh
  BindingsParameterType


Project
  included name of active bindings
  this is interesting, should a Project contain parts of the UIConfig?

Setup
  could have a different set of bindings in each Setup
  think about whether this belongs here
  Bindings feel somewhat unrelated to track configuration, ports, levels, preset, etc.
  they are almost always static and change based on the context of use, e.g.
  different foot controllers, different laptops, alternative controllers
