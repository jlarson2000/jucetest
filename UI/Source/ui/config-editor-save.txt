ConfigEditor

manages a set of ConfigPanels to display portions of the configuration
loads the MobiusConfiguration and makes it available to the configuration panels
responsible for reading and writing the configuration file and informing MobiusInterface

PresetPanel
  clones the list of Presets


Multi-object panels

master config has a list of objects
one is edited at a time

What does Save do?
  - saves just the one visible object
  - saves all objects that have been edited
  - saving all would be easier, if not then when a different object is selected
    without saving we would have to prompt to save or revert changes
  - either way need a Revert button to throw away the changes to the selected object
  - New, adds an object to the list but doesn't save it
  - Would be nice to have a Clone option to copy the selected object as a new object
  - Reset button to initialize the object to a default state
  - buttons
      Save - saves all edited presets (or just the current one)
      Cancel - cancels all edits in progress
      Revert - reverts the current object, would need a Revert All?
      Save All - saves and closes if Save just saves the current
        - this seems confusing most dialogs Save means save and close
      so
        Save = Save All and close
        Cancel = Cancel All and close
        Revert = revert all to be consistent with save/cancel
          most of the time objects will be edited one at a time anyway
        Save This One - isn't that useful, why do this and keep the session open?
          if Save doesn't Save

      over thinking this, just have full save/cancel/revert and if we need indivual add later
      if switching objects cancels will want a "Changes have not been saved" alert
      switching editing windows does not auto-save or cancel, if it did we would need an alert
      nice to have the Save/Revert buttons become highlighted if there are changes

      if you start one panel, then select another it is hidden but the editing session remains
      when the second panel is closed need to restore the previous one

      if you open a panel but make no changes, when another is selected it is hidden

      changes made to one type of object (mostly global) may impact parameter values in others
      will need a way to refresh panels whose editing sessions are in progress
        actually even if they aren't in progress
