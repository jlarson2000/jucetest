The default display will be arranged in this Component hierarchy
Each level will have a back pointer to the parent which could just use
the juce::Componennt parent with downcasting, but I'd like to start with
concrete back pointers.

This is mostly necessary for action propagation. An alternative would be
to pass Supervisor, DisplayManager, or MainWindow down.

Supervisor
  DisplayManager
    MainWindow
      MainMenu
      MobiusDisplay
      ConfigEditor

MobiusDisplay
  ActionButtons
    ActionButton
  StatusArea
    StatusElement
  TrackStrips
    TrackStrip
