things that suck

we've got a set of Parameter objects that
define the parameter but they don't know how to set that in MobiusSimulator
same will apply to the real engine

Need a parallel set of InternalParameter objects that we can map between
with ordinals

In TrackStrip::configure
  the element names come from UIConfig
  we match those to StripElementDefinitions by name but the names
    don't match Parameter
  StripElement could find the associated Parameter and save it so
  we don't have to have code to set the action target
    all sliderValueChanged methods could be the same


  the constructor for the various script eleemnts sets the range
  could get this from the Parameter

  the only thing the element subclasses need to do is take the slider
  value and put it in the right MobiusState
    - could use the same thing that MobiusSimulator uses but that's temporary
    - NO, these are driven from MobiusState so can still share the basic value
      testing, all we have to do is provide one method to pull it out of the right place


so StripElementDefinition has an alternate constructor that takes a Parameter
  can get name/displayName from there but the names don't match

StripElement

While we're cleaning up names might as well fix XmlRenderer so that it uses
The Parameter object for the element names?

 hmm, I like seeing just "output" in the XML and it is consistent with "feedback"
 which would otherwise be "feedbackLevel"  So if we want to keep those
 names hould change the names of the Parameters to OutputParameter


Other types of "output" can use qualfiied names.
