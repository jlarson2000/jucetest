Nasty configuration ordering problem

Almost all display elements configure themselves from UIConfig
A few need MobiusConfig

LoopStack is weird because it wants MobiusConfig to get the maximum
number of possible loops per track, but this isn't available until AFTER the
UIConfig update propagagates down

LoopStack::getPreferredSize wants maxLoops and this is called during the
initial layout during the UIConfig walk

But we can't just flip the order of the UIConfig and MobiusConfig walks
because TrackStrip doesn't even know what child components to create until
after UIConfig is processed.

It really needs both at the same time.

I guess we could just let it default to 4 and let it resize itself after we
do the MobiusConfig walk, which we would have to do anyway if you edit the
config after the UI is built.

still seems messy
