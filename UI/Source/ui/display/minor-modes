--- paint code has

Overdub, Mute, Reverse
SpeedOct %d, SpeedStep %d, SpeedToggle %d, SpeedBend %d
PitchOct, PitchStep, PitchBend
  - no PitchToggle, I think because 1/2 Speed is a toggle
TimeStretch
SyncMaster, TrackSyncMaster, MIDISyncMaster
Capture, Solo, GlobalMute, GlobalPause, Window

These are all concatenated into one long string

Recording flag becomes Capture, and is sensitive to tstat->globalRecording
