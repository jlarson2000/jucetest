Current UI has a Scope selector with values

   Global
   Track 1
   Track 2
   ...
   Group A
   Group B

Could continue that or just have a Track/Group text box where
you type in the name.

That might be interesting, any other binding scopes?  Would allow things
like 1-4 or 1,3,5

Binding model does not support that though, would have to replicate it
and then collapse it back to a tracks specifier.

Kind of like this, scopes were always a little hard to explain and rarely used.

Can we use arguments for this?

What functions have arguments?

RunScript <name>
  track scope doesn't make sense yet
  would a script ever want to want to run in just one track?
  
SelectLoop <number>
  track scope does make sense here

SelectTrack <number>
  track scope doesn't make sense here

PlaySample <name>
  no track scope

SelectLoop is the problem child, it can have both a track number and loop number
as arguments.  Could qualify them
  track:1 loop:2

If not set have to assume order, track would have to be first which makes
a global "set all tracks to loop 2" harder.  But really, why would you want that?
Examples
  SelectLoop 1
    selects loop 1 in the current track
  SelectLoop 1 2
    selects loop 2 in track 1
    should we consistently put the track number first?
  SelectLoop 2 track:1
    name to make it unambiguous

Control bindings for switches would always have a numeric argument
   Pan 64
   Pan 1 64
     seems less natural than Pan 64 1

putting track at the end works as long as functions can't have variable optional
arguments, if any do have to name them

would be really nice to have argument help show under the arguments field relevant
to the selected target

Yes, start with just Arguments, that gets us there and we can add sugar later
