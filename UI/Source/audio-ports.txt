Notes on the "ports" concept

 * The container organizes audio data into "ports" which are collections
 * of mono channels, either input or output.  We have only ever supported
 * ports with two stereo channels.  The MobiusConfig/TrackSetup can
 * set which ports tracks receive on and send to.
 *
 * The acutal number of channels currently configured in the hardware may not
 * match that so if we ask for port data that doesn't exist the container
 * is expected to return something empty.  We should probably allow it
 * to return nullptr to indiciate port misconfiguration.  At the moment,
 * we're only supporting a single port, which will always be there.
 * We'll ask for whatever port happens to be configured, but the container
 * may not give us that one.
