 * This file is very old and I don't use much of it any more.
 * I used to be strict about using PUBLIC/PRIVATE/INTERFACE in front
 * of every method implementation but usage is inconsistent now.
 * I still like to use PRIVATE but if it isn't annotated you can
 * assume it is PUBLIC.  
 *
 * INTERFACE is required for functions that are exposed as Windows
 * DLL exports when you don't want to use .exp files but I don't think
 * we have any of that in Mobius.
 *
 * Avoid cluttering this with stuff that might better belong in Util.h.

 * INTERFACE is used whenever a method should be exported from the DLL.

 * PUBLIC is used for methods that are in the public interface, but which
 * aren't to be exported from the DLL.  It doesn't really do anything, but
 * is nice for documentation.
 *
 * PRIVATE is used for private or protected methods.

 * PATH_MAX
 * 
 * The Posix constant that corresponds to the older MAXPATHLEN constant.
 * This is supposed to be in limits.h, but that doesn't appear to be
 * reliable.  Various comments indicate that gcc doesn't have it.
 * MS VC++ version of 'limits.h' only defines this macro if _POSIX_ is
 * defined, so this makes sure it is defined no matter what
 * 
 * Posix manual indicates that it may not be defined unless
 * _POSIX_SOURCE is on, and that implementations that require the
 * use of pathconf() will not define it at all.
 *
 * This works out to be a lot of crap to remember so here we just ensure
 * that its set always.
 * 
 * NOTE: The usual Windows value for MAX_PATH which they define in 
 * stdlib.y is 260, which is disturbingly small.  The Windows value for
 * PATH_MAX defined in limits.h is 512.
