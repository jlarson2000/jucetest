There are two uses of threads in Mobius

  UI Thread
    tells the UI to update every 10ms
      not time critical
    used for communication from the interrupt up to the engine
      unclear, potentially more time critical
    communication down into the interrupt can just schedule things
      for the audio thread to pick up

  Timer thread
    more time critical
    generates MIDI clocks out
       clocks are 24 ppq so not so bad
       jitter is expected by most devices
    same MIDI clock generator is also used to synchronize internal track playback
    Juce may have facilities for this so focus on the UI thread

MIDI out has been done in the audio interrupt, seems safe

OSC out is probably not safe since it requires network comms
  may more time critical than the UI thread, though OSC export is usually done for
  display rather than sync

Calls to process audio buffers in the interrupt have not in the past been
time stable, so wasn't a good fit for MIDI clocks, revisit

In general, try to get the engine out of the business of sending a stable MIDI clock
  that is arguably part of the UI/container

Focus on the UI thread till we need a highres timer for  MIDI
