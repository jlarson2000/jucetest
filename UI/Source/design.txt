Config Header
  displays title and border
  no actions

Config Footer
  displays configurable buttons
  forwards action to parent

ConfigPanel
  displays header/footer/content
  forwards footer button to subclass for appropriate action
  informs parent that it is done


Wrapping the panel inside the Popup makes subclassing complicated

to the popup, the panel has buttons, how it is structured internally doesn't matter

what do we subclass, the panel or the popup?

Nice to have popup just display the panel in a few ways but not care what it is
  means this can't use automatic members

class PresetPanel : ConfigPanel {"Presets", ButtonSave | ButtonCancel};

ways of showing a configuration panel

  dialog window
    heavy weight, needs a modal wait loop

  simple compoment
    easiest, arbitrary position


  slider
    I guess like a simple component, just slides in and out

yeah, keep the panel where the guts are and contain it in something
